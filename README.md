 I write YAML spells, summon containers, and conjure up resilient infrastructures. 🧙‍♂️ Whether it's CI/CD pipelines, cloud automation, or high availability, I thrive on making systems scalable, secure, and efficient. 🚀 If it can be scripted, containerized, or optimized, I’m on it! Let’s build magic together! 🔥☁️
